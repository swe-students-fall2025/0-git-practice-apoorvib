## What I found interesting about this article is how it breaks down software development into clear and beginner-friendly concepts. It explains not only what programming is, but also how software is built, tested, and maintained. I liked that it introduces development methodologies like Agile and Waterfall in a way thatâ€™s easy to understand, showing how different teams might approach building software. This gives a good perspective on how real-world projects are managed, not just how to write code. Overall, the article gave me a clear roadmap for how to start learning and practicing software development in a structured way.
